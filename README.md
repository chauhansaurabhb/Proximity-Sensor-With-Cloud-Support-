# ProximitySensor
Proximity Sensor data(Proximity Value) stored to Cloud (Salesforce) using webservices.We used real Proximity Sensor located on 
mobile phone(Proximity is  used to make sure whether user is active or not, Object is close or far from the device) and stored 
real time proximity value generated by Proximity Sensor to Cloud. In order to create webservices, we used Mule ESB(AnyPoint Studio).
